# Server

Anything that can be done client-side should be done client-side.

Ideally this server shouldn't exist and everything should be done on clients but unfortunately it's not yet possible to build programs on browsers with the current tooling. This is more of a `rustc` issue and progress is being made in:

- https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/issues/722.
- https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/2566

## Setup

The easiest way to run the server is via [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose):

```sh
docker compose up
```

This will:

1. Create a [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) database
2. Build the server from source
3. Start the server
