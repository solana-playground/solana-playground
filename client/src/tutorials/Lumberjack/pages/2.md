# Energy System

Many casual games in traditional gaming use energy systems. Meaning that actions in the game cost energy which refills over time. This is how you can build it on chain.
Recommended to start with the Tiny Adventure Tutorial if you do not have any prior Solana knowledge.

## Anchor program

(lib.rs file)
Here we will build a program which refills energy over time which the player can then use to perform actions in the game.
In our example it will be a lumberjack which chops trees. Every tree will reward one wood and cost one energy.

### Creating the player account

First the player needs to create an account which saves the state of our player. Notice the last_login time which will save the current unix time stamp of the player he interacts with the program.
Like this we will be able to calculate how much energy the player has at a certain point in time.  
We also have a value for wood which will store the wood the lumberjack chucks in the game.

```rs
const MAX_ENERGY: u64 = 5;
const TIME_TO_REFILL_ENERGY: i64 = 30;

pub fn init_player(ctx: Context<InitPlayer>) -> Result<()> {
    ctx.accounts.player.energy = MAX_ENERGY;
    ctx.accounts.player.last_login = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;
    Ok(())
}
```

...

```rs
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct InitPlayer <'info> {
    #[account(
        init,
        payer = signer,
        space = 1000,
        seeds = [b"player", signer.key().as_ref()],
        bump,
    )]
    pub player: Account<'info, PlayerData>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub signer: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

#[account]
pub struct PlayerData {
    pub name: String,
    pub level: u8,
    pub xp: u64,
    pub wood: u64,
    pub energy: u64,
    pub last_login: i64
}
```

### Chopping trees

Then whenever the player calls the chop_tree instruction we want to check if the player has enough energy and reward him with one wood.
So let's add a new instruction "chop_tree". This one will check if the player has enough energy and if so give the player one wood and decrease energy by one. Notice how we use a custom error so that it can be properly handled in the client later, to show the player a refill energy popup for example.

Add this at the top of the file at line 8.

```rs
#[error_code]
pub enum ErrorCode {
    #[msg("Not enough energy")]
    NotEnoughEnergy,
}
```

Add this right below the init_player instruction in the mod lumberjack.

```rs
pub fn chop_tree(mut ctx: Context<ChopTree>) -> Result<()> {
    let account = &mut ctx.accounts;
    // This we will add in the next step.
    update_energy(account)?;

    if ctx.accounts.player.energy == 0 {
        return err!(ErrorCode::NotEnoughEnergy);
    }

    ctx.accounts.player.wood = ctx.accounts.player.wood + 1;
    ctx.accounts.player.energy = ctx.accounts.player.energy - 1;
    msg!("You chopped a tree and got 1 wood. You have {} wood and {} energy left.", ctx.accounts.player.wood, ctx.accounts.player.energy);
    Ok(())
}
```

And this at the bottom under the init accounts at line 56.

```rs
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct ChopTree<'info> {
    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [b"player", signer.key().as_ref()],
        bump,
    )]
    pub player: Account<'info, PlayerData>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub signer: Signer<'info>,
}
```

### Calculating the energy

The interesting part happens in the update_energy function. We check how much time has passed and calculate the energy that the player will have at the given time.
The same thing we will also do in the client. So we basically lazily update the energy instead of polling it all the time.
This is a common technic in game development.

You need to add the update_energy function outside of the mod lumberjack section.

```rs
pub fn update_energy(ctx: &mut ChopTree) -> Result<()> {
    let mut time_passed: i64 = &Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp - &ctx.player.last_login;
    let mut time_spent: i64 = 0;
    while time_passed > TIME_TO_REFILL_ENERGY {
        ctx.player.energy = ctx.player.energy + 1;
        time_passed -= TIME_TO_REFILL_ENERGY;
        time_spent += TIME_TO_REFILL_ENERGY;
        if ctx.player.energy >= MAX_ENERGY {
            break;
        }
    }

    if ctx.player.energy >= MAX_ENERGY {
        ctx.player.last_login = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;
    } else {
        ctx.player.last_login += time_spent;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

Now type build in the terminal and then afterwards deploy to deploy the program to dev net.

Now we can have a look at the client and how to call these instructions and calculate the energy in the frontend to be able to show the player how much energy he has left and when the next energy refill will take place.

Let's chop some trees!
