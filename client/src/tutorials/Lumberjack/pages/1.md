## Setup and run

1. In the terminal below type `build` to the project.
2. Connect your wallet from bottom left.
3. Save your keypair.
4. Get some SOL: `solana airdrop 2` (If you get this error:
   Process error: Client error: "Too many requests for a specific RPC call, contact your app developer or support@rpcpool.com."
   then pick another RPC Endpoint on the bottom left the little gear symbol. `devnet-alchemy` works well for me). If you still can't get any dev net sol try https://solfaucet.com/ and paste the address from your playground wallet in there.
5. Run `solana airdrop 2` until you have 6 SOL.
6. You can see your balance by typing `solana balance` in the terminal on the bottom. You can also see your balance in the bottom bar.
7. Type `deploy` This will now deploy your game to devnet. This will take a while.
8. Write `run` in the terminal: This runs the TypeScript code in client.ts.
   This will create a new game data account.
