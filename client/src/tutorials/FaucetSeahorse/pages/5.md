# Replenishing tokens

An option to return unused tokens is a feature found on many faucet interfaces. So lastly lets add an instruction to facilitate replenishing the faucet. This instruction fulfills a role identical to that of a token transfer through a wallet interface or the command line using the Solana CLI.

```py
@instruction
def replenish_bitcorn_tokens(
  signer: Signer,
  mint: TokenMint,
  user_account: TokenAccount,
  faucet_account: TokenAccount,
  amount: u64
):
  user_account.transfer(
    authority = signer,
    to = faucet_account,
    amount = u64(amount)
  )
```
