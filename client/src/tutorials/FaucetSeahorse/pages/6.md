# Creating our token with the CLI

Before we begin testing we will need to create a new token for our faucet which we can do easily from the Solana Playground terminal. Make sure you have devnet SOL on your connected wallet.

```bash
solana airdrop 5
```

Then run the following command.

```bash
spl-token create-token
```

The new token address created is the token mint account. The token by default has 9 decimals, something we'll come to later. Store the address in a text file or notepad for easy reference. Next we create a token account for our current address and mint a large number of tokens to ourselves. We do this with two commands as follows.

```bash
spl-token create-account <TOKEN MINT ADDRESS>
spl-token mint <TOKEN MINT ADDRESS> 1000000000
```

Again make sure to store your token account in a text file or notepad for reference.
