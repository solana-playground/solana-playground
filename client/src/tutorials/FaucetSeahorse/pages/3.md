# Drip tokens

Next up is the drip instruction which allows users to receive tokens from the faucet. To call the instruction we pass seven arguments, the first five are straightforward: signer, the token mint account, the faucet, the faucet token account and the user's token account. The last two are new for us. `PriceAccount` is a special account type in Seahorse used for Pyth oracle price feeds. `Clock` references Solana's Clock sysvar, which we are going to use to generate a timestamp. Read more on Clock [here](https://www.seahorse.dev/using-seahorse/accounts#clock).

We generate a timestamp with the method `clock.unix_timestamp()` and then check it against the `last withdrawal` field on our faucet. If the difference is less than 30 seconds the program will panic and return a message. This is our system of rate limiting faucet usage to limit spam, a true production application would likely use something more sophisticated.

```py
@instruction
def drip_bitcorn_tokens(
  signer: Signer,
  mint: TokenMint,
  faucet: BitcornFaucet,
  faucet_account: TokenAccount,
  user_account: TokenAccount,
  bitcoin_price_account: PriceAccount,
  clock: Clock
):
  timestamp: i64 = clock.unix_timestamp()

  assert mint.key() == faucet.mint, 'Faucet token does not match the token provided'
  assert timestamp - 30 > faucet.last_withdraw, 'Please try again in 30 seconds'
```
