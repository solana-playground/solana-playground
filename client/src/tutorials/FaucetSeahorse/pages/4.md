# Drip tokens continued

We continue our instruction by extracting the price of Bitcoin from our `PriceAccount` price feed with the `validate_price_feed` method, into which we pass the string `devnet-BTC/USD`. This returns an object from which we can grab the price of Bitcoin in US dollars.

The amount of tokens the faucet transfers to users is determined by the price of one Bitcoin in US dollars.

```py
  btc_price_feed = bitcoin_price_account.validate_price_feed('devnet-BTC/USD')
  btc_price = u64(btc_price_feed.get_price().price)

  print("The Bitcorn price is ", btc_price)
```

The transfer of tokens to the user's wallet is handled by the `TokenAccount` transfer method. Read more [here](https://www.seahorse.dev/using-seahorse/spl-tokens) on how token transfers work in Seahorse.

```py
bump = faucet.bump

faucet_account.transfer(
  authority = faucet,
  to = user_account,
  amount = btc_price,
  signer = ['mint', mint, bump]
)
```
