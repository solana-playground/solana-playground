# Create the counter: Initialize the counter

Let's check the function that is called `create_counter`. In this function there is an empty space that we should complete to actually obtain our Counter Account.

```rust
let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
```

Now let's set our initial default parameters to our counter:

- The counter will start at 0
- Setting the authority to the person that is creating the Counter.

```rust
counter.authority = ctx.accounts.authority.key();
counter.count = 0;
```

Nice! we have finished completing our first function.

**_Function completed_**

```rust

   pub fn create_counter(ctx: Context<CreateCounter>) -> Result<()> {

       msg!("Creating a Counter!!");

       let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
       counter.authority = ctx.accounts.authority.key();
       counter.count = 0;

       msg!("Current count is {}", counter.count);
       msg!("The Admin PubKey is: {} ", counter.authority);

       Ok(())
}
```
