# CreateCounter: Initialize the counter ðŸ‘€ 3/6

We will work in the first function that is called ```create_counter``` . In this function there is an empty space that we should complete to actually obtain our Counter Account. 

```bash
let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
```
Nice, now let's set our default parameters to our counter. Our initial requirements will be: 
- Starting the count from 0
- Setting the authority to the person that is creating the Counter.

```bash
counter.authority = ctx.accounts.authority.key();
counter.count = 0;
```

Nice! we have finished completing our first function. 

Function completed:

 ```bash

    pub fn create_counter(ctx: Context<CreateCounter>) -> Result<()> {

        msg!("Creating a Counter!!");

        let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.authority = ctx.accounts.authority.key();
        counter.count = 0;

        msg!("Current count is {}", counter.count);
        msg!("The Admin PubKey is: {} ", counter.authority);

        Ok(())
 }
 ```
