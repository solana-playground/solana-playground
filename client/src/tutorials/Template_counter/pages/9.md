# Testing the Counter: Fetching Data

Solana Playground is a powerful tool that can detect the accounts and data structs in our programs. 

Because of that, we are able to fetch all our on-chain data just clicking buttons!

The testing script is designed to: 
- Call Create Counter 1 time
- Call Update Counter 1 time

***That's why if you test 5 times, you will fail in Create Counter, because the counter is already created!*** 

So if you click Test 5 times, you will be updating the counter 5 times with a total count of 5.
