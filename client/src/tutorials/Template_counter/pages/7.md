# Deploy the Counter Program

In order to deploy the program to the Devnet network, we will have to make sure we have connected a wallet to Solana Playground and also having enough SOL on it!

To request SOL, type in the console:

```bash
solana airdrop 2
```

After that, deploy your smart contract to the Blockchain via the deploy button.
