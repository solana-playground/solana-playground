# Structure of the Program

As you probably have seen, our initial program is divided in 3 main sections: Functions, Data Validators and Data Structures.

- **Smart Contract Functions**: a section with the operations and logic of the program.

- **Data Validators**: a section for all the accounts that we will have to create and declare. As you can see, the _Context_<Name> from the functions is actually the same as the Data validators.

- **Data Structures**: the structure of the accounts / rust structs that we will use to store info! In the program is pretty clear, the Counter account will store 2 things:

```rust
#[account]
pub struct Counter {
    authority: Pubkey,
    count: u64,
}
```

So if we want to call the Count of the counter we will just have to do -> counter.count
