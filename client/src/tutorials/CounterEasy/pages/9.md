# Testing the Counter: Fetching Data

Solana Playground is a powerful tool that can detect the accounts and data structs in our programs.

Because of that, we are able to fetch all our on-chain data by just clicking a few buttons!

The testing script we ran before is designed to:

- Call Create Counter 1 time
- Call Update Counter 1 time

**_That's why if you test 5 times, you will fail in Create Counter, because the counter is already created!_**

So if you click test 5 times, you will be updating the counter 5 times with a total count of 5. Fetch counter data after that and see if it worked!
