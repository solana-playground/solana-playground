# Interactive tests

For a more interactive test environment, click the test tube icon on the side bar to open the test window.

Next, expand the `createCounter` panel in the test window:

Lets populate the fields so we can create a counter account.

Under accounts, we need to add the `authority` (which is a Pubkey), as well as the `counter` (which is also a Pubkey).

The authority is easy, its our wallet! Click the authority input field and select `My address` from the dropdown. This will automatically populate your playground wallet.

Next, we will need to get the counter Publickey by deriving it `From seed` since this is a PDA.

To do that, we need to click in the counter input field and select the `From seed` option:

Next, we need to change the Seed(1) to a Publickey type (it is a `string` by default).

To do that, we can click the `Add new seed` button below the last seed input field:

Select `Pubkey` from the dropdown:

Now click the remove icon next to the `Seed(1): string` input field to remove it.

Copy and paste in your authority pubkey into the seed input field and click `generate`:

You should now see your PDA key generated in the creator account input field:

Click the `Test` button to create your counter on devnet!

You should see an output similar to this:

Awesome! Next, lets interact with our Counter.
