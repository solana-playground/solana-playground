# Testing the Counter: Fetching and Updating The Counter Data

Solana Playground is a powerful tool that can detect the accounts and data structs in our programs.

Because of that, we are able to fetch all of our on-chain data just by clicking a few buttons!

## Fetching The Data

You can click `Fetch all` without adding an address, or copy the `counter` Pubkey we generated in the last step and paste it into the Counter `address` input field, and then click `Fetch`.

Fetching by an address lets you fetch another counter on-chain instead of the one built locally, whereas the Fetch all gets the address from the locally built program automatically.

You should get back the counter `publicKey` and `account`, and verify our `count` is set to `"0"` like we set it to initially!

## Updating The Data

For our final test, we will update our counter count and verify the update on-chain.

Lets expand the `updateCounter` panel and update the account fields.

First, set the authority by clicking `My address` again:

Next, copy and paste your counter publicKey in from above, or derive it from seed (authority pubKey) again:

Now you are ready to click test!

You should have a console log that looks something like this:

If we fetch our data again, we should be able to verify that it was in fact updated on-chain:

Boom, done! You have just created a counter, verified the data, updated the count on-chain, and verified the update!

Give yourself a pat on the back!
