# Create the counter: Data Validator

In this section you don't have to write anything but It will be very important to look carefully the CreateCounter Data Validator because is relevant.

Previously we have called the ctx.accounts.counter, that is basically this account :

```rust
    #[account(init, seeds=[authority.key().as_ref()], bump, payer=authority, space=100)]
    counter: Account<'info, Counter>,
```

This account is a PDA, you can obtain more info about PDAs in the [Solana Cookbook](https://solanacookbook.com/core-concepts/pdas.html#facts).

But the important concepts to know about it, is that it must the initialized and must contain a seed, a bump and some required space.

In our case we used the authority key as the seed, we introduced a bump, we have set the authority to the payer(payer=person who is creating this PDA) and we have set space to 100, that is actually more than we need.

Finally, we also declared the Authority Account. This account has been set to the Signer address.

```rust
#[account(mut)]
authority: Signer<'info>,
```
