# Create the counter: Data Validator

In this section you don't have to write anything but it will be very important to look carefully at the _CreateCounter_ Data Validator because it's relevant.

Previously we have called the `ctx.accounts.counter`, that is basically this account:

```rust
#[account(
    init,
    seeds=[authority.key().as_ref()],
    bump,
    payer=authority,
    space=100
)]
counter: Account<'info, Counter>,
```

This account is a PDA, you can obtain more info about PDAs in the [Solana Cookbook](https://solanacookbook.com/core-concepts/pdas.html#facts).

But the important concepts to know about it is that it must be initialized and must contain a seed, a bump and some required space.

In our case we used the authority key as the seed, we introduced a bump, we have set the authority to the payer(payer=person who is creating this PDA) and we have set space to 100, that is actually more than we need.

Finally, we also declared the Authority Account. This account has been set to the Signer address.

```rust
#[account(mut)]
authority: Signer<'info>,
```
