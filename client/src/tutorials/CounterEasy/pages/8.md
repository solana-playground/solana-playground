# Testing the Counter

### Time to test our Counter Program!

_There are two ways we can test our program._

The first is by simply clicking on `Test` inside the Explorer, which runs our Client test we have already created for you.
This is where you will define your test cases for any project/program you write.

Feel free to review the code and check out where we create a counter, fetch it, and update it in 3 different test cases.

Next, we will use the test UI to interact with our program.
