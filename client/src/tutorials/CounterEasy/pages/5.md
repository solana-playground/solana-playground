# Update the counter ✍️

Let's check the function `update_counter`. This function must add +1 to the counter count every time its called.

I recommend you to try it by yourself instead of following the tutorial :) , using the concepts learned from the previous function!

Ok, so the solution is quite simple.

We will have to declare again the counter account from the Data Validator as we did before:

```rust
let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
```

And we will have to call the count property from counter and add +1

```rust
counter.count += 1 ;
```

**Function Completed** :

```rust
pub fn update_counter(ctx: Context<UpdateCounter>) -> Result<()> {
    msg!("Adding 1 to the counter!!");
    let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
    counter.count += 1 ;
    msg!("Current count is {}", counter.count);
    msg!("{} remaining to reach 1000 ", 1000 - counter.count);

    Ok(())
}
```
