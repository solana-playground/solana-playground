# Create Mint in the client

First in the client we create a fungible token.
For this we set the mint authority to our playground wallet keypair. This means we will be able to mint new tokens whenever we want. You can also set the mint authority to another keypair if you want to have a different keypair that can mint tokens.
We also set the decimals to 9. This means that we can mint 1 token and then split it into 1,000,000,000 pieces. This is the smallest amount of tokens that can be transferred.

Then we find the address for a PDA which will be the authority for the token account. This means that the program will be able to transfer tokens from this account.

Then we create a metaplex instance and use it to create a semi fungible token. We set the uri to a url that contains the meta data for the token. We also set the name, symbol, seller fee basis points, update authority, mint authority, decimals, token standard and if it is mutable.

Then we log the address of the token that was created. You can look up this address in the solana explorer and it should show the meta data for the token and the icon.

```js
const mintAuthority = pg.wallet.keypair;

const decimals = 9;

let [tokenAccountOwnerPda] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
  [Buffer.from("token_account_owner_pda")],
  pg.PROGRAM_ID
);

const metaplex = new Metaplex(pg.connection).use(
  keypairIdentity(pg.wallet.keypair)
);

const createdSFT = await metaplex.nfts().createSft({
  uri: "https://shdw-drive.genesysgo.net/AzjHvXgqUJortnr5fXDG2aPkp2PfFMvu4Egr57fdiite/PirateCoinMeta",
  name: "Gold",
  symbol: "GOLD",
  sellerFeeBasisPoints: 100,
  updateAuthority: mintAuthority,
  mintAuthority: mintAuthority,
  decimals: decimals,
  tokenStandard: "Fungible",
  isMutable: true,
});

console.log(
  "Creating semi fungible spl token with address: " + createdSFT.sft.address
);
```
