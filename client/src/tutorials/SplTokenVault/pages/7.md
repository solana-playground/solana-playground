# Transfer out

Now we want to transfer token from the program back to the player. We will do this by sending tokens from the token account that the program owns to the token account that the player owns. This part is a bit more complicated in the program because we need to invoke the instruction signed with the PDA seeds that own the token account. Maybe try yourself first and then look at the solution if you get stuck.

## Client

We call the `transferOut` method on our program and pass in the amount of tokens we want to transfer in. The accounts are the same as the accounts we used for the initialize method.

```js
txHash = await pg.program.methods
  .transferOut(new anchor.BN(1 * mintDecimals))
  .accounts({
    tokenAccountOwnerPda: tokenAccountOwnerPda,
    vaultTokenAccount: tokenVault,
    senderTokenAccount: tokenAccount.address,
    mintOfTokenBeingSent: createdSFT.mintAddress,
    signer: pg.wallet.publicKey,
  })
  .signers([pg.wallet.keypair])
  .rpc(confirmOptions);

console.log(`Transfer one token out of the vault.`);
await logTransaction(txHash);

tokenAccountInfo = await getAccount(pg.connection, tokenAccount.address);
console.log(
  "Owned token amount: " + tokenAccountInfo.amount / BigInt(mintDecimals)
);

tokenAccountInfo = await getAccount(pg.connection, tokenVault);
console.log(
  "Vault token amount: " + tokenAccountInfo.amount / BigInt(mintDecimals)
);
```

## Program

First we create a SPL Token transfer instruction. This is the instruction that we will send to the SPL Token program. We will be using the `anchor_spl::token::transfer` method to send the instruction to the SPL Token program. This time we need to provide the seeds that own the token account. We also need to provide the bump seed that we can get from the anchor context which contains a hash map that has all the PDA bumps in it.

```rust
pub fn transfer_out(ctx: Context<TransferAccounts>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
    msg!("Token amount transfer out: {}!", amount);

    // Below is the actual instruction that we are going to send to the Token program.
    let transfer_instruction = Transfer {
        from: ctx.accounts.vault_token_account.to_account_info(),
        to: ctx.accounts.sender_token_account.to_account_info(),
        authority: ctx.accounts.token_account_owner_pda.to_account_info(),
    };

    let bump = ctx.bumps.token_account_owner_pda;
    let seeds = &[b"token_account_owner_pda".as_ref(), &[bump]];
    let signer = &[&seeds[..]];

    let cpi_ctx = CpiContext::new_with_signer(
        ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
        transfer_instruction,
        signer,
    );

    anchor_spl::token::transfer(cpi_ctx, amount)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

If everything worked you should see the following output after you `build` and `deploy` the program and `run` the client:

```bash

Gratulation! You can now send spl tokens into a program and out again.
Keep in mind though that everyone can call the TransferOut instruction.
So if you for example want to use tokens in a game, then you may only want to send out tokens to the player when they killed a monster for example and not just make it a public function.
For that you would send some tokens to the program as a setup and then send them out whenever a player collects a chest or kills a monster or something like that.
