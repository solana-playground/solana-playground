# Transfer in

Now we want to transfer tokens into the program. We will do this by sending tokens to the token account that the program owns.

## Client

Now this part you need to write yourself. You can try yourself first and then look at the solution if you get stuck.

We call the `transferIn` method on our program and pass in the amount of tokens we want to transfer in. The accounts are the same as the accounts we used for the initialize method.

```js
txHash = await pg.program.methods
  .transferIn(new anchor.BN(1 * mintDecimals))
  .accounts({
    tokenAccountOwnerPda: tokenAccountOwnerPda,
    vaultTokenAccount: tokenVault,
    senderTokenAccount: tokenAccount.address,
    mintOfTokenBeingSent: createdSFT.mintAddress,
    signer: pg.wallet.publicKey,
  })
  .signers([pg.wallet.keypair])
  .rpc(confirmOptions);

console.log(`Transfer one token into the vault.`);
await logTransaction(txHash);

tokenAccountInfo = await getAccount(pg.connection, tokenAccount.address);
console.log(
  "Owned token amount: " + tokenAccountInfo.amount / BigInt(mintDecimals)
);

tokenAccountInfo = await getAccount(pg.connection, tokenVault);
console.log(
  "Vault token amount: " + tokenAccountInfo.amount / BigInt(mintDecimals)
);
```

## Program

We add the following code to our program:

First we create a SPL Token transfer instruction. This is the instruction that we will send to the SPL Token program. We will be using the `anchor_spl::token::transfer` method to send the instruction to the SPL Token program.

```rust
pub fn transfer_in(ctx: Context<TransferAccounts>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
    msg!("Token amount transfer in: {}!", amount);

    // Below is the actual instruction that we are going to send to the Token program.
    let transfer_instruction = Transfer {
        from: ctx.accounts.sender_token_account.to_account_info(),
        to: ctx.accounts.vault_token_account.to_account_info(),
        authority: ctx.accounts.signer.to_account_info(),
    };

    let cpi_ctx = CpiContext::new(
        ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
        transfer_instruction,
    );

    anchor_spl::token::transfer(cpi_ctx, amount)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

You will also need to add a new import at the top for the transfer function;

```rust
use anchor_spl::token::{Mint, Token, TokenAccount, Transfer};
```
