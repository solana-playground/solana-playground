# Todo App Tutorial

Today we'll be creating a classic todo app. Building a todo app is a very efficient way to understand how CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) work on Solana. Users will create a profile and then individual todo tasks. When a task is completed is will be marked as done. To achieve this firstly we'll need to create a structure for our user profile. We do this in Seahorse with a class which we've called `UserProfile`. This will be used to create a program derived account (PDA) with two fields, the public address of the owner and the `last_todo` which is of type `u8` i.e. an unsigned integer, 8 bits in size (0 to 255).

```py
class UserProfile(Account):
  owner: Pubkey
  last_todo: u8
```

Our second class `TodoAccount` will be for the individual todos that the user wishes to store. The text documenting the todo will be stored as a string `todo: str` and its completion status will be stored as a boolean `done: bool`. We'll assign each todo an index `index: u8` and finally we store a record of the todo's owner `owner: Pubkey`.

```py
class TodoAccount(Account):
  owner: Pubkey
  index: u8
  todo: str
  done: bool
```
