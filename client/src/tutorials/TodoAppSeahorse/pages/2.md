# Initialize the user profile

Next we'll need an instruction to initialize the user profile. The function will take two arguments -- an owner and an empty instance of the `UserProfile` class. We initialize the `UserProfile` instance with seeds consisting of the raw string "user_profile" and the owner's public key. In this way we ensure that each user can only have one profile and the addresses of those profiles will be unique. We also set the `owner` and `last_todo` fields to the owner's public address and 0 respectively.

```py
@instruction
def init_user_profile(owner: Signer, user_profile: Empty[UserProfile]):
  user_profile = user_profile.init(
    payer = owner,
    seeds = ['user_profile', owner]
  )

  user_profile.owner = owner.key()
  user_profile.last_todo = 0
```
