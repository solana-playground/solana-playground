# Marking tasks as done

Finally we add an instruction for marking a todo as completed. This function will take two arguments -- an owner and an instance of the todo account. Firstly we need to check that the signer of the transaction is in fact the owner of the account. We do this with an assert statement. Then we set the `todo_account.done` field to `True` and print a message confirming the change.

```py
@instruction
def mark_task_as_done(
  owner: Signer,
  todo_account: TodoAccount
):
  assert owner.key() == todo_account.owner, 'Only the owner of the task can mark as done'

  todo_account.done = True

  print('This todo has been marked as done')
```
