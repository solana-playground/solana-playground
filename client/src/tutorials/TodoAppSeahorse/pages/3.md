# Adding todo tasks

Our second instruction allows users to add new tasks to their list. This function has four arguments: an owner, a user profile, an empty instance of `TodoAccount` and a string describing our todo. First we initialize the todo account. In this case there are three seeds -- the string "todo_account", the owner's public key and the `user_profile.last todo` field.

```py
@instruction
def add_task(
  owner: Signer,
  user_profile: UserProfile,
  todo_account: Empty[TodoAccount],
  todo: str
):
  todo_account = todo_account.init(
    payer = owner,
    seeds = ['todo_account', owner, user_profile.last_todo]
  )
```

We then proceed to set the fields for the newly initialized `todo_account`. `todo` is set to the string we passed into the function and `owner` is set to the owner's public address. The index of our account is set to the `user_profile.last_todo` which is then incremented by one. In this way every new todo task the user creates will have a different index. Given the index is stored as a `u8`, a single user will be able to create up to 256 individual todo items before running out of indexes.

```py
todo_account.todo = todo
todo_account.owner = owner.key()

todo_account.index = user_profile.last_todo
user_profile.last_todo += 1
```
