# Testing

Build and deploy the code using the 'Build & Deploy' tab and do some testing of your own on the 'Test' tab. An easy way to track the results of your transactions will be through 'Accounts > TodoAccount > Fetch All' and 'Accounts > UserProfile > Fetch All'.

You can also run the automated tests found in the 'tests' folder on the explorer tab. Simply type `test` on the command prompt to do so.
