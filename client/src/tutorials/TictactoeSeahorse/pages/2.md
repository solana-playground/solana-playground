# Initialize a new game

Let's create an instruction to initialize a new game. The function will take four arguments, the signer, an empty `Game` account instance and the public addresses of the 2 players. The game is a program derived account (PDA) initialized by two seeds, a string "ttt" and the signer's public key address. We set the game status to 0 which means active, when the game enters a finished state this will turn to 1. Current player is set to player 1.

```py
@instruction
def init_game(owner: Signer, player1: Pubkey, player2: Pubkey, game: Empty[Game]):
  game = game.init(
    payer = owner,
    seeds = ['ttt', owner]
  )
  game.players[0] = player1
  game.players[1] = player2
  game.game_status = 0
  game.curr_player = 1
```
