# Checking for win conditions

Next we want to create our `win_check` function which checks the grid to see if a player has won the game. There are eight possible lines which can be drawn on a 3x3 grid which gives us eight possible win conditions in a game of tic-tac-toe. We check each one in turn and if any one of the conditions is true we return a game state indicating the current player has won. If no one has won, we also check to see if the board is full. If we find it is full, we return a game state of `Draw` otherwise we return `InProgress` indicating the game is still in play.

```py
def win_check(grid: Array[u8, 9], player: u8)-> GameState:

  # check for 8 possible win conditions
  if(
    (grid[0] == player and grid[1] == player and grid[2] == player) or
    (grid[0] == player and grid[3] == player and grid[6] == player) or
    (grid[6] == player and grid[7] == player and grid[8] == player) or
    (grid[2] == player and grid[5] == player and grid[8] == player) or
    (grid[0] == player and grid[4] == player and grid[8] == player) or
    (grid[2] == player and grid[4] == player and grid[6] == player) or
    (grid[1] == player and grid[4] == player and grid[7] == player) or
    (grid[3] == player and grid[4] == player and grid[5] == player)
  ):
    if player == 1:
      return GameState.Player1Wins
    else:
      return GameState.Player2Wins

  # check for full board i.e. draw
  for i in range(9):
    if grid[i] == 0:
      return GameState.InProgress

  return GameState.Draw
```
