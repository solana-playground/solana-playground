# Testing

Build and deploy the code using the "Build & Deploy" tab. Do some testing of your own on the "Test" tab. To test properly you will need to input two player addresses, both of which you should control. Fortunately Playgrounds makes this easy for us. Simply generate a new wallet address from the wallet tab and use the send function to send a small amount to the newly created wallet address. This could also be done from the command line without a GUI if you wish to practice your Solana CLI commands.

You can also run the automated tests found in the "tests" folder on the explorer tab. Simply type `test` on the command prompt to do so. For simplicity the tests use the same wallet for player 1 and player 2 which is possible as the program does not check that these are different addresses.
