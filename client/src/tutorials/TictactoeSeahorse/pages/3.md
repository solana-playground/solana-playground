# Playing the game

Our second instruction allows for a player to take their turn. The function takes four arguments: two accounts - the signer and the game instance - and two integers - the player and their move. The first part of this instruction is entirely input validation. We do five checks to ensure that the instruction is being called in a correct way that fits the rules of the game. Each of these checks is commented below.

```py
@instruction
def play_game(player: Signer, game_data: Game, played_by: u8, move_position: u8):
  # check the game is active
  assert game_data.game_status == 0, 'This game is already finished'

  # check for valid signer
  assert game_data.players[played_by -1] == player.key(), 'Invalid Signer'

  # check the correct player is taking their turn
  assert played_by == game_data.curr_player, 'Invalid Player'

  # check that move is possible
  assert move_position > 0 and move_position < 10, 'Invalid move, off the grid'

  # check that grid position is unoccupied
  assert game_data.grid[move_position -1] == 0, 'Invalid move, position occupied'
```

Next we move to our game logic. Firstly we decrement the `move_position` by one so it fits the zero indexing of the array. Then we mark the grid with the player's number. Next we check if the player has won. This logic will be separated out into a separate function `win_check` which we'll come to next. We also switch the current player. Lastly we print the status of the game based on the result of the `win_check` function.

```py
move_position -= 1

game_data.grid[move_position] = game_data.curr_player

game_status = win_check(Array(game_data.grid, len = 9), game_data.curr_player)

if game_data.curr_player == 2:
  game_data.curr_player = 1
else:
  game_data.curr_player = 2

if(game_status == GameState.InProgress):
  print("Ready for next move")

if(game_status == GameState.Player1Wins):
  game_data.game_status=1
  print("Player1 wins")

if(game_status == GameState.Player2Wins):
  game_data.game_status=2
  print("Player2 wins")

if(game_status == GameState.Draw):
  game_data.game_status=3
  print("Draw")
```
