## Build 🔧️

We can build our program by clicking the **Build** button on the left sidebar or by typing `build` inside the terminal.

You should see 3 warnings about unused variables. As the compiler suggests, you can put an underscore before the variable names to get rid of the warnings. This won't have any effect on our program.

## Deploy 🚀️

In order to deploy, we need to have a wallet with some SOL inside of it. You can see your connection status from the bottom left corner. If you are not connected, you can click **Connect to Playground Wallet** button on the left panel or type `connect` inside the terminal and click **Continue**.

> ⚠️ When you first connect, playground will automatically send airdrop requests in devnet. You can see your address and your balance from the bottom bar. If you get a connection error when using playground, you are most likely getting rate-limited. You can switch to a different RPC endpoint from the Settings(Gear) icon from the bottom left side of your screen to fix the error.

You can now press **Deploy** button on the left panel or type `deploy` inside the terminal to deploy your program.

The program is now on-chain!
