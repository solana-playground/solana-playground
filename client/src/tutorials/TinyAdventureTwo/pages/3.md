# Running

![](/tutorials/tiny-adventure-two/tinyAdventureTwoDiagram.jpg)

If you ‘run‘ the program three things will happen.

1. First we find two program addresses. One for the game data of level 1 and then one chest vault
   to deposit SOL in that we can then give out to the player when they reach the end of the level.
2. Then we call initialize on our program which will initialize these accounts on chain.
   The logged in wallet will pay for these accounts.
3. Then we call resetLevelAndSpawnChest, this will reset the player position to 0 and fill the chest vault account with 0.1 SOL. For that we use a cross program invocation (CPI). So we call the `system_program::transfer` to transfer the SOL to the chest vault account.
4. In a loop we call 3 times moveRight. This will move the character to the right (increase the play position u8). When the player reaches position 3 the reward of the chest account will be transferred to him. Here we can not use a CPI, because the chestVault is not owned by the system program. So we directly access the lamport balance of both accounts and increase the player accounts lamports and decrease the lamports from the chest_vault. (When using `try_borrow_mut_lamports` you need to make sure that all accounts in sum have the same SOL before and after and changed accounts need to be mutable and be signer and/or owned by the program)
5. You played through the game, gratulation.

Let's say now you want to only players be able to collect the chest who know the password to the chest.
Try your self first.

...

This is how you can do that for example. You add another parameter to the move right function which is the password:

```rust
pub fn move_right(ctx: Context<MoveRight>, password: String) -> Result<()> {
    let game_data_account = &mut ctx.accounts.game_data_account;
    if game_data_account.player_position == 3 {
        msg!("You have reached the end! Super!");
    } else if game_data_account.player_position == 2 {
        game_data_account.player_position = game_data_account.player_position + 1;

        if password != "gib" {
            panic!("The chest password is wrong. Please try again!");
        }

        msg!(
            "You made it! Here is your reward {0} lamports",
            CHEST_REWARD
        );

        **ctx
            .accounts
            .chest_vault
            .to_account_info()
            .try_borrow_mut_lamports()? -= CHEST_REWARD;
        **ctx
            .accounts
            .player
            .to_account_info()
            .try_borrow_mut_lamports()? += CHEST_REWARD;
    } else {
        game_data_account.player_position = game_data_account.player_position + 1;
        print_player(game_data_account.player_position);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

And if you want to make it a bit nicer you can add a custom error code which you then can parse in the client to show a proper error:

```rust
#[error_code]
pub enum MyError {
   #[msg("Password was wrong")]
   WrongPassword,
}
```

...

```rust
if password != "gib" {
    return err!(MyError::WrongPassword);
}
```

and in the client you also need to add this parameter:

```js
txHash = await pg.program.methods
  .moveRight("gib")
  .accounts({
    chestVault: chestVaultAccount,
    gameDataAccount: globalLevel1GameDataAccount,
    systemProgram: web3.SystemProgram.programId,
    player: pg.wallet.publicKey,
  })
  .rpc({ skipPreflight: true });
```

So now only people who know the password can solve the level. One thing to keep in mind though, is that all data is on chain. So people can look at a successful transaction and read the data. So this should not be used for any security relevant data.
