# Hello world program üåçÔ∏è

We are going to be writing a [Hello world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) program with [Anchor](https://anchor-lang.com/).

Anchor offers a lot of improvements over Native Solana programs in terms of developer friendliness and security of the programs. Let's get started!

## Import Anchor

Let's start by importing Anchor to be used in our program:

```rs
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
```

## Declare Program Id

With Anchor, we have to declare our program's [public key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography). This is being used by Anchor to improve the security of our program.

We can easily declare our program's id with `declare_id!` macro:

```rs
declare_id!("");
```

> üîçÔ∏è Playground will automatically fill the program id when you build the program. You can leave it empty.

## Create Program

We create our program with `#[program]` macro:

```rs
#[program]
mod hello_world {
    use super::*;

    pub fn hello(ctx: Context<Hello>) -> Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

This is the syntax for declaring an Anchor program.

- You can consider `mod` in Rust as a different file, it doesn't have access to the outer scope. In order to bring the outer scope inside `mod` we use `use super::*` which roughly means: import everything that's from outside of this scope. This way we have access to `anchor_lang::prelude::*` and other things that we might define.
- We create our `hello` instruction. Every instruction in Anchor takes [Context](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/context/struct.Context.html) as the first parameter. Accounts that were passed to the instruction can be accessed from `ctx` parameter. Notice `Context` takes an inner type `Hello`, we will define that type next.
- We return `Ok(())` to indicate that the program call completed successfully.

## Log "Hello, World!"

In Rust, we usually log messages with `println!` macro but in Solana, we use `msg!` macro.
Inside the `hello` function body, you can type `msg` and press Enter to use Playground snippet for logging messages.
You can log whatever you want but for the purpose of the tutorial let's log `Hello, World!`:

```rs
msg!("Hello, World!");
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Return value of the instruction, `Ok(())`, should always be at the end of the function body.

## Context

Our `hello` instruction is ready. Now we need to define the `Hello` struct that we specified in the instruction parameter.

We define accounts by deriving `#[derive(Accounts)]` trait in our `Hello` struct. Since we don't need any accounts for this instruction, we leave the struct empty:

```rs
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Hello {}
```

That's it! Next, we build the program.
